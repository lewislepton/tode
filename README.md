# tode

2d [tode] based game engine that utilises nape & tiled.

This engine is super basic, but also is not fantatically made [at least in my mind]. So please expect bugs.<br>Im still working with this & want to create something that can make game development a bit easier & fun

**tode** can also work [currently] with Tiled & TMX files, though im looking to change to something else. But more importantly is the shapes & how they interact with the world

# Install

To install **tode**, head to your terminal/command line & input this

    haxelib git tode https://github.com/lewislepton/tode.git

**tode** should automatically install the latest nape version that works with haxe 4. But if you run into something that says '*nope to nape*'. Then enter this into your terminal/command line & put this in:

    haxelib install nape-haxe4

BOOSH. YOU ARE READY!!! 👍

# Wanna Help?

Im not killing myself about getting X or Y feature in, its all about having fun & making something nice in a time you want to. But if you would like to help, then by all means spooge commits all over me 😘

My only main requirement is how the code looks. Things have to be simple & kept simple. Syntax is so important & cant go down the rabbit hole of things that dont make sense to people first seeing it.<br>If someone can look at the code & know whats going on right away, thats good 👍

# Things I Need/Want To Do

- [ ] Create some examples [that would help 😉]
- [ ] Fix the odd bug that has generated extra 'hidden' shapes when using Tiled maps
- [ ] BIG possibility to change the collision & physics to something way faster & less cumbersome. Hey, i love you nape. But damn you can be slow to work with 😅
- [ ] Support for other tile based level editors, like OGMO & Tilesetter. Tiled should be done first 😉
- [ ] Comment the code. So it helps other people than myself
- [ ] Major series of other things i cant think of right now
- [ ] Make a better front page for this repo that doesnt have me waffling. Also an icon. Everyone loves icons 😘

*This engine includes some things from other libraries & works that others have put up, such as the TMX stuff. But is only included inside the engine to cut out the need of more downloading from other sources. I dont take credit for these works, but i do edit them a lot to make sure things work the way they should 😘*
